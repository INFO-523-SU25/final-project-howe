description: "For starters, my goal to create an interactive dashboard is due to the utiliy I see in creating such a dashboard in my current career. 
                Creating an interactive dashboard is something I have never pushed myself to do, and so, while I may regret the extra work, I find
                it'll be a task with high future reward. I also think that an interactive dashboard is a favorable way to get the viewers interested 
                in the data. /n
              Secondly, the reason i'd like to study crime in Mexico has to do with my background. I grew up spending all of my summers in Mexico, I
                even attended kindergarten there. I expereinced two very different worlds in Mexico, as, at times, I would stay at a small ranch town in the 
                mountains and at times on the Pacific coast in a city known to hold a large tourist attraction. I did not live a sheltered life there, 
                I would stay up past midnight playing kickball with the neighborhood kids and, later on in life, would attend dances with my cousins. Only 
                to walk home after in low to middle income neighborhoods. I felt very safe growing up there; however, it is common knowledge that Mexico 
                is not the safest country. That is why, when searching through databases through Kaggle's platform, "An Extensive Compilation of Criminal 
                Incidents in Mexico" peaked my interest. It's a dataset sourced from the Official Mexican Government Website. The dataset provides me an
                opportunity to learn more about crime in Mexico. I'm mostly interested in answering whether the crime is wide-spread throughout the country 
                or located in specific pockets. I also found a dataset regarding Cartel Networks. It would be interesting to merge the dataset to see if 
                Cartel hotspots play as large of a role as one would assume. 
              As a mother who also works full time, I am concerned that I am trying to bite off more than I can handle by creating an interactive   
                dataset with little prior experience doing so. My plan of attack is to dedicate minimum an hour daily to the project. Whether   
                that's during work break or during the girl's athletic practices, prioritizing this project will be a great personal reward."
