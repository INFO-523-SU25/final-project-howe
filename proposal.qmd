## Proposal 

  My goal is to create an interactive dashboard is due to the utility I see in creating such a dashboard in my current career.
Creating an interactive dashboard is something I have never pushed myself to do, and so, while I may regret the extra work, I find
it'll be a task with high future reward. I also think that an interactive dashboard is a favorable way to get the viewers interested
in the data.

  Secondly, the reason I'd like to study crime in Mexico has to do with my background. I grew up spending all of my summers in Mexico, I
even attended kindergarten there. I experienced two very different worlds in Mexico, as, at times, I would stay at a small ranch town in the
mountains and at times on the Pacific coast in a city known to hold a large tourist attraction. I did not live a sheltered life there,
I would stay up past midnight playing kickball with the neighborhood kids and, later on in life, would attend dances with my cousins. Only
to walk home after in low to middle income neighborhoods. I felt very safe growing up there; however, it is common knowledge that Mexico
is not the safest country. That is why, when searching through databases through Kaggle's platform, "An Extensive Compilation of Criminal
Incidents in Mexico" piqued my interest. It's a dataset sourced from the Official Mexican Government Website. The dataset provides me an
opportunity to learn more about crime in Mexico. I'm mostly interested in answering whether the crime is wide-spread throughout the country
or located in specific pockets. I also found a dataset regarding Cartel Networks. It would be interesting to merge the dataset to see if
Cartel hotspots play as large of a role as one would assume.

  As a mother who also works full time, I am concerned that I am trying to bite off more than I can handle by creating an interactive
dataset with little prior experience doing so. My plan of attack is to dedicate minimum an hour daily to the project. Whether
that's during work break or during the girl's athletic practices, prioritizing this project will be a great personal reward.


## Dataset

```{python}
#| label: load-dataset
#| message: false

# load dataset into dataframe
mexi_crimes = pd.read_csv('data/mexico_crime.csv')
cartels = pd.read_csv('data/BACRIM2020_Nodes.csb')

# print dataframe shapes
print('Mexico Crime Statists DF Shape:', mexi_crimes.shape)
print('Mexico Crime Statists DF Shape:', cartels.shape)

#print dataframe column names
print('Mexico Crime Statists Column Names:', mexi_crimes.columns.tolist())
print('Mexico Crime Statists Column Names:', cartels.columns.tolist())
```

The main dataset for this project is 'Mexican Crime Statistics:Comprehensive (2015-2023)' sourced from Mexico's official government website (https://www.gob.mx/sre/en).
This dataset is a compilation of criminal incidents reported across Mexico. The dataset is composed of 332416 rows and  9 columns. I chose this data as the criminology 
record will be highly useful in assessing whether the crime in Mexico is evenly widespread throughout the country or clustered in certain regions. 

The second dataset of interest is 'BACRIM2020_Nodes' sourced from Mexico's official governent branch Centro Geo. This data in this dataset was put together by piecing 
together national and local newspapers in Mexico, along with narco blogs. The dataset is made up of 151 rows and 4 columns. I'm specifically interested in 
State column. I would like to investigate whether there is a strong correclation to crimes and cartel hotspots. 


## Questions

Question #1: Is the crime in Mexico evenly widespread throughout the country or is it most common in specific regions.

Quesiton #2: Does Cartel presence lead to a strong increase of crimes in the area, or only caratel specific offenses. 

## Analysis plan

- I plan to answer question 1 by creating a new vector that sums up the columns per region in Mexico. This will create a new vector displaying crimes per region. 
I can then compare the magnitude of crime rates per region. 

- I plan to answer question 2 by comparing the vector created above, crime per regions in Mexico, with cartel presence in such regions. I plan to create an interactive scatter plot 
to display any possible correlation.
