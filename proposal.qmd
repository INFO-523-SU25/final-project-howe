## Proposal 

  The goal is to create an interactive visualizations to facilitate in better understanding crime patterns in Mexico. If time permits, I plan to 
aim a bit higher and produce and interactive dashboard. There is a great utility in creating such a dashboard in many fields. Creating an interactive 
dashboard is something I have never pushed myself to do, and so, while I may regret the extra work, I find it'll be a task with high future reward.
I also think that an interactive dashboard, or an interactive visualization, is a favorable way to get the viewers interested in the data.

  Secondly, the reason for analysing crime patterns in Mexico has to do with my background. I grew up spending all of my summers in Mexico, including
attended kindergarten there. I experienced two very different worlds in Mexico; at times, I would stay in a small ranch town in the mountains and at times 
on the Pacific coast in a city known to hold a large tourist attraction. I did not live a sheltered life there, nor did I stay in the safer upper class 
neighborhoods. I felt very safe growing up there; however, it's common knowledge that Mexico is not the safest country. That is why, when searching through 
Kaggle's platform, 'An Extensive Compilation of Criminal Incidents in Mexico' piqued my interest. It's a dataset sourced from the Official Mexican Government 
Website. The dataset provides me anopportunity to learn more about crime in Mexico. 


I'm mostly interested in answering whether the crime is wide-spread throughout the country
 or located in specific pockets. I also found a dataset regarding Cartel Networks. It would be interesting to merge the dataset to see if
Cartel hotspots play as large of a role as one would assume.

My weekly plan:
8/7-8/10  | Create interactive graphs and moduls to help me compare criminolgy statistics
8/11-8/13 | Finsih graphs and begin working on write up
8/14-8/17 | Work on Write up finalzie website detains & organization
8/18-8/20 | Work on Presentation


## Dataset

```{python}
#| label: load-dataset
#| message: false

# load dataset into dataframe
mexi_crimes = pd.read_csv('data/mexico_crime.csv')
cartels = pd.read_csv('data/BACRIM2020_Nodes.csv')

# print dataframe shapes
print('Mexico Crime Statists DF Shape:', mexi_crimes.shape)
print('Mexico Crime Statists DF Shape:', cartels.shape)

#print dataframe column names
print('Mexico Crime Statists Column Names:', mexi_crimes.columns.tolist())
print('Mexico Crime Statists Column Names:', cartels.columns.tolist())
```

The main dataset for this project is 'Mexican Crime Statistics:Comprehensive (2015-2023)' sourced from Mexico's official government website (https://www.gob.mx/sre/en).
This dataset is a compilation of criminal incidents reported across Mexico, form the years 2015-2023. The dataset is composed of 332416 rows and  9 columns. I chose 
this data as the criminology record will be highly useful in assessing whether the crime in Mexico is evenly widespread throughout the country or clustered in certain regions. 

The second dataset of interest is 'BACRIM2020_Nodes' sourced from Mexico's official governent branch Centro Geo. This data in this dataset was put together by piecing 
national and local newspapers together, along with narco blogs. The dataset is made up of 151 rows and 4 columns. I'm specifically interested in State/region column. I 
would like to investigate whether there is a strong correclation to crimes and cartel hotspots. 


## Questions

Question #1: Is the crime in Mexico evenly widespread throughout the country or is it most common in specific states.

Quesiton #2: Does Cartel presence lead to a strong increase of crimes in the area, or only cartel specific offenses. 

## Analysis plan

- I plan to answer question 1 by creating a new vector that sums up the columns per region in Mexico. This will create a new vector displaying crimes per state, 
which will alow me to can compare the magnitude of crime rates per state. I plan on making and interactive bar plot to visual the data, each bar representing 
a different state. When the user hoovers over each bar, more details will appear; such as, highest types of crime. This will create a nice visual of the crime 
distribution throughout the coutry. 


- I plan to answer question 2 by comparing the vector created above, crime per state in Mexico, with cartel presence in such regions. I would like to make a simple
interactive dashboard to aid with answering this question. My plan is to have a scatter plot based on crime rates and possible amount of known cartel presence in the area. 
The user would then be able to select different states to take part of the visual. Depedning on how noisy the graph looks, I may only include areas with the highest crime 
rates or areas with the most cartel presence. If time does not permit, my plan is to create an interactive scatter plot that gives more details when the user hoovers over
the bars, instead of the dashboard.
